/*****************************************************************************
* NOTE1:
* The maximum number of active objects QF_MAX_ACTIVE can be increased
* up to 64U, if necessary. Here it is set to a lower level to save some RAM.
*
* NOTE2:
* On Cortex-M0/M0+/M1 (architecture v6-M, v6S-M), the interrupt disabling
* policy uses the PRIMASK register to disable interrupts globally. The
* QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI level is zero, meaning that all interrupts are
* "QF-aware".
*
* NOTE3:
* On Cortex-M3/M4/M7, the interrupt disable/enable policy uses the BASEPRI
* register (which is not implemented in Cortex-M0/M0+/M1) to disable
* interrupts only with priority lower than the threshold specified by the
* QF_BASEPRI macro. The interrupts with priorities above QF_BASEPRI (i.e.,
* with numerical priority values lower than QF_BASEPRI) are NOT disabled in
* this method. These free-running interrupts have very low ("zero") latency,
* but they are not allowed to call any QF services, because QF is unaware
* of them ("QF-unaware" interrutps). Consequently, only interrupts with
* numerical values of priorities eqal to or higher than QF_BASEPRI
* ("QF-aware" interrupts ), can call QF services.
*
* NOTE4:
* The QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI macro is useful as an offset for enumerating
* the "QF-aware" interrupt priorities in the applications, whereas the
* numerical values of the "QF-aware" interrupts must be greater or equal to
* QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI. The values based on QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI can be
* passed directly to the CMSIS function NVIC_SetPriority(), which shifts
* them by (8 - __NVIC_PRIO_BITS) into the correct bit position, while
* __NVIC_PRIO_BITS is the CMSIS macro defining the number of implemented
* priority bits in the NVIC. Please note that the macro QF_AWARE_ISR_CMSIS_PRI
* is intended only for applications and is not used inside the QF port, which
* remains generic and not dependent on the number of implemented priority bits
* implemented in the NVIC.
*
* NOTE5:
* The selective disabling of "QF-aware" interrupts with the BASEPRI register
* has a problem on ARM Cortex-M7 core r0p1 (see ARM-EPM-064408, errata
* 837070). The workaround recommended by ARM is to surround MSR BASEPRI with
* the CPSID i/CPSIE i pair, which is implemented in the QF_INT_DISABLE()
* macro. This workaround works also for Cortex-M3/M4 cores.
