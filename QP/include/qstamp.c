* @brief Application build time-stamp
* @details
* This module needs to be re-compiled in every new software build. To achive
* this, it is recommended to delete the object file (qstamp.o, or qstamp.obj)
* in the build directory before each build. (Most development tools allow
* you to specify a pre-build command, which is the ideal place to delete
* the qstamp object file.)
